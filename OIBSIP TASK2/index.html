        <h3>Father of the Nation</h3>
        <img src="img1.jpeg" id="img1" alt="">
        <p class="para">Indians widely describe <br> Gandhi as the father
            of the nation. <br> The title "The Father of the Nation"
            for Gandhi <br> is not an official title and has not been officially accorded by Goverment of India.
            <br> Origin of this title is traced back to a radio <br> address
            (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 <br> by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose <br>
            addressed Gandhi as "The Father of the Nation". <br>
            on 28 April 1947,Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as "Father of the Nation".

        <p class="para">
            According to Aturly Murali,Indian congress in <br> the 1920s
            appealed to Andhra pradesh <br> peasants by creating Telegu language plays <br>
            that combined Indian mythology and legends, <br> linked the, to
            Gandhi's as messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian
            nationalist leaders and saints. <br>
            The plays built support among peasants <br> steepde in tradional Hindu culture,
            <br> according to Murali, and this effort made <br> Gandhi a folk hero in Telegu speaking villages, <br>
            a sacred messiah-like figure.
